        <h1>Nguyen, Bao</h1>
        <p>I'm studying Computer Science because I've always been interested in working with computers. I also saw a movie about hacking
        and that just sparked my interest in coding. The last reason why I was interested in Computer Science is because the jobs were
        high demand.</p>
